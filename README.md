# Exp 8: Reproducing an Image Using Prompts for Image Generation

### Date : 20-11-25

### Register No : 212223080057

## Aim:

To demonstrate the ability of text-to-image generation tools to reproduce an existing image by crafting precise prompts.

## Procedure:

### Image 1: Red Vintage Car:

* **Analysis:**

  * Objects: Red vintage car, street, old buildings
  * Colors: Red, grey, brown tones
  * Lighting: Natural daylight
  * Background: Urban street scene
  * Style: Realistic photography

* **Basic Prompt:**
  *"A red vintage car parked on a city street."*

* **Refined Prompt:**
  *"A realistic photo of a shiny red vintage car parked on a cobblestone city street, with old European-style buildings in the background, bright daylight."*

---

### Image 2: Coffee with Latte Art:

* **Analysis:**

  * Objects: Cup of coffee, latte art, wooden table, book
  * Colors: Brown, cream, light beige
  * Lighting: Warm natural light
  * Background: Indoor cozy setting
  * Style: Realistic photography

* **Basic Prompt:**
  *"A cup of coffee with latte art on a wooden table."*

* **Refined Prompt:**
  *"A realistic close-up of a white ceramic cup of coffee with heart-shaped latte art, placed on a rustic wooden table beside an open book, warm sunlight streaming in."*

## Tools Used:

* **DALL·E** (OpenAI)
* **Stable Diffusion**

## Comparison Report:

* **Image 1 (Car):** The generated reproduction closely matched the style and atmosphere, but the building designs varied slightly.
* **Image 2 (Coffee):** The reproduction was very close to the original, especially in lighting and latte art, with only minor differences in table texture.

## Conclusion:

By analyzing and refining prompts, the AI-generated images were able to reproduce the originals with high accuracy. This highlights the importance of **prompt engineering and iteration** when using text-to-image models.
